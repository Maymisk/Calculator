# Calculator 😬

This is a simple calculator.




## My journey

Back in 2021, I'd heard a calculator was a good project for beginners. I decided to try creating one myself - that's when I realized I had to study more 💀

Instead of doing it alone, I followed through a [**Web Dev Simplified video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw), and made sure I understood every bit of code I wrote.


## Functionalities

- Basic math operations
- Decimal numbers
